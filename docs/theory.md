# Equalizer Theory

## What is an Equalizer?
An equalizer (EQ) is an audio filter that adjusts the balance of different frequency components in a signal.

## Types of Equalizers
- **Graphic Equalizer**: Uses a set of fixed frequency bands.
- **Parametric Equalizer**: Allows fine control over frequency, gain, and bandwidth.
- **Shelving Filter**: Boosts or cuts frequencies above/below a certain threshold.

## How NAudio Handles Equalization
NAudio provides various audio processing capabilities, including:
- Filtering audio streams
- Applying custom DSP effects
- Handling different audio formats
